# Performance Analysis and Enhancement Opportunities

## Current Architecture Overview

Uber Scanner is a high-performance pattern scanner built in Rust that leverages:
- SIMD-powered regex engine for pattern matching
- Rayon for parallel file processing
- BufReader/BufWriter for efficient I/O
- Atomic file operations via tempfile

## Critical Architecture Analysis for Feature Extensibility

### Current Architectural Strengths
The codebase demonstrates good separation of concerns with distinct modules for:
- **CLI** (`cli.rs`): Clean command parsing with clap derive macros
- **Scanner** (`scanner.rs`): Isolated pattern matching logic
- **Replacer** (`replacer.rs`): Self-contained replacement operations
- **Config** (`config.rs`): Centralized configuration management
- **Errors** (`errors.rs`): Unified error handling with thiserror

### Architectural Limitations Requiring Attention

#### 1. Tight Coupling Between Core Operations
**Issue**: Scanner and Replacer modules have independent file traversal implementations
**Impact**: Adding features like incremental scanning requires modifying multiple modules
**Solution**: Extract a shared `FileProcessor` trait with pluggable operations

#### 2. Monolithic Process Functions
**Issue**: Functions like `run_scan` and `run_replace` mix concerns (I/O, business logic, orchestration)
**Impact**: Difficult to add features like progress reporting or cancellation
**Solution**: Implement pipeline architecture with composable stages

#### 3. Limited Extension Points
**Issue**: No plugin system or hooks for custom processing
**Impact**: Every new feature requires core codebase modification
**Solution**: Introduce event-driven architecture with lifecycle hooks

### Refactoring Requirements for Proposed Features

#### For File Name Replacement Feature
**Current State**: File operations are deeply embedded in processing logic
**Required Changes**:
- Abstract file system operations into `FileSystemManager` trait
- Implement transactional file operations with rollback support
- Add file metadata tracking layer

**Estimated Refactor Scope**: ~30% of replacer.rs, new abstraction layer

#### For Incremental Scanning
**Current State**: No state persistence between runs
**Required Changes**:
- Add `StateManager` for scan history
- Implement file fingerprinting system
- Create cache invalidation logic

**Estimated Refactor Scope**: New module, minimal changes to existing code

#### For Watch Mode
**Current State**: Batch processing only, no event handling
**Required Changes**:
- Introduce async runtime (tokio/async-std)
- Implement event bus for file system notifications
- Refactor main loop to support continuous operation

**Estimated Refactor Scope**: Major architectural shift, ~40% codebase impact

#### For Distributed Scanning
**Current State**: Single-process, local-only operation
**Required Changes**:
- Implement work queue abstraction
- Add serialization for work units and results
- Create coordinator/worker architecture
- Network communication layer

**Estimated Refactor Scope**: Requires significant re-architecture, ~60% impact

### Recommended Architectural Improvements

#### 1. Introduce Core Abstractions
```rust
trait FileProcessor {
    type Input;
    type Output;
    fn process(&self, input: Self::Input) -> Result<Self::Output>;
}

trait FileSystem {
    fn walk(&self, path: &Path) -> Box<dyn Iterator<Item = PathBuf>>;
    fn read(&self, path: &Path) -> Result<String>;
    fn write(&self, path: &Path, content: &str) -> Result<()>;
    fn rename(&self, from: &Path, to: &Path) -> Result<()>;
}

trait StateStore {
    fn save_state(&self, key: &str, value: &[u8]) -> Result<()>;
    fn load_state(&self, key: &str) -> Result<Vec<u8>>;
}
```

#### 2. Implement Pipeline Architecture
```rust
struct Pipeline<T> {
    stages: Vec<Box<dyn Stage<T>>>,
}

trait Stage<T> {
    fn execute(&self, input: T) -> Result<T>;
}
```

#### 3. Add Dependency Injection
- Use builder pattern for component construction
- Allow runtime configuration of implementations
- Enable testing with mock implementations

### Migration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Non-Breaking Refactors (Low Risk)
1. Extract interfaces without changing behavior
2. Add abstraction layers with default implementations
3. Introduce dependency injection gradually
4. Maintain backward compatibility

#### Phase 2: Feature Additions (Medium Risk)
1. Implement new features using new abstractions
2. Gradually migrate existing features
3. Deprecate old implementations
4. Maintain parallel implementations temporarily

#### Phase 3: Architecture Evolution (High Risk)
1. Full async transformation if needed
2. Implement plugin system
3. Add distributed capabilities
4. Complete migration to new architecture

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Before any refactoring
   - Unit tests for all modules
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Regression test suite

2. **Feature Flags**: Progressive rollout
   - Toggle between old/new implementations
   - A/B testing for performance
   - Gradual user migration

3. **Compatibility Layer**: Smooth transition
   - Maintain CLI compatibility
   - Support old configuration formats
   - Provide migration tools

### Architectural Debt Assessment

**Current Technical Debt**:
- Sequential pattern matching: Medium impact, easy fix
- Lack of abstraction: High impact, moderate fix
- Missing state management: Medium impact, moderate fix

**Debt Introduction Risk for New Features**:
- File renaming: Low (well-isolated)
- Watch mode: High (requires async)
- Distributed: Very High (fundamental change)

### Conclusion on Architecture Readiness

The current architecture is **well-suited for incremental improvements** but will require **strategic refactoring for advanced features**. Priority should be:

1. **Immediate**: Add abstractions without breaking changes
2. **Short-term**: Implement high-value, low-impact features
3. **Long-term**: Plan architectural evolution for advanced capabilities

The codebase does NOT require a complete rewrite but needs evolutionary refactoring to support the full feature roadmap while maintaining stability and performance.

## Identified Bottlenecks

### 1. Sequential Pattern Matching in Scanner
**Location**: `src/scanner.rs:37-48`

The current implementation iterates through patterns sequentially for each line:
```rust
for (name, re) in &self.patterns {
    if re.is_match(&line) {
        // Process match
    }
}
```

**Impact**: With N patterns and M lines, we get O(N*M) regex evaluations per file.

**Solution**: Implement regex set matching to test all patterns simultaneously:
- Use `regex::RegexSet` for initial match detection
- Only run individual regex when set indicates a match
- Reduces complexity to O(M) for non-matching lines

### 2. Single-threaded Directory Scanning
**Location**: `src/scanner.rs:53-66`

Directory traversal and file processing happen sequentially:
```rust
for entry in WalkBuilder::new(dir).build() {
    let matches = self.scan_file(path)?;
    all_matches.extend(matches);
}
```

**Impact**: Large codebases with thousands of files process one at a time.

**Solution**: Parallelize file processing with Rayon:
- Collect file paths first
- Process files in parallel using `par_iter()`
- Aggregate results with thread-safe collection

### 3. Redundant File Content Reading
**Location**: `src/replacer.rs:77-78`

Files are read entirely into memory as strings:
```rust
let content = fs::read_to_string(path)?;
```

**Impact**: Large files consume excessive memory; binary file detection happens late.

**Solution**: 
- Implement streaming with early binary detection
- Use memory-mapped files for large file processing
- Add file size threshold for strategy selection

### 4. Inefficient Empty Line Cleanup
**Location**: `src/replacer.rs:92-94`

Empty line cleanup processes entire file content after block removal.

**Impact**: Multiple regex passes over potentially large strings.

**Solution**: 
- Combine cleanup with initial processing pass
- Use state machine for line-by-line cleanup
- Avoid string reallocation with in-place modification

## Performance Improvement Opportunities

### 1. Regex Compilation Caching
**Opportunity**: Cache compiled regex patterns across runs

**Implementation**:
- Serialize compiled patterns to disk cache
- Use pattern hash as cache key
- Invalidate on pattern file modification
- Expected improvement: 10-20% for frequent scans

### 2. Incremental Scanning
**Opportunity**: Skip unchanged files since last scan

**Implementation**:
- Track file modification times
- Store scan results with timestamps
- Only rescan modified files
- Expected improvement: 80-90% for incremental scans

### 3. SIMD String Search Pre-filtering
**Opportunity**: Use SIMD instructions for literal string pre-filtering

**Implementation**:
- Extract literal prefixes from regex patterns
- Use `memchr` or custom SIMD search for literals
- Only run regex on potential matches
- Expected improvement: 30-50% for literal-heavy patterns

### 4. Memory Pool Allocation
**Opportunity**: Reduce allocation overhead with object pools

**Implementation**:
- Pool String/Vec allocations for line buffers
- Reuse regex match objects
- Pre-allocate result collections
- Expected improvement: 5-10% overall

### 5. Parallel Block Processing
**Opportunity**: Process independent blocks in parallel

**Implementation**:
- Identify non-overlapping block regions
- Process blocks concurrently with Rayon
- Merge results maintaining order
- Expected improvement: 20-30% for block-heavy configs

### 6. Lazy Pattern Compilation
**Opportunity**: Only compile patterns that match file extensions

**Implementation**:
- Associate patterns with file types
- Compile patterns on-demand per file type
- Cache compiled patterns per worker thread
- Expected improvement: 15-25% with diverse file types

### 9. File Name Scanning and Replacement
**Feature**: Rename files matching replaced patterns

**Rationale**: When replacing core identifiers (class names, module names, component names), the corresponding files often share the same name. For example:
- Replacing `UserController`  `UserHandler` in code
- Should also rename `UserController.java`  `UserHandler.java`
- And `UserController.test.js`  `UserHandler.test.js`

**Components**:
- Pattern matching on file names (not just content)
- Smart case conversion (PascalCase, camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case)
- Directory name matching for nested structures
- Import/require statement auto-update
- Git mv integration for version control

**Implementation Strategy**:
```yaml
# Example configuration
file_renames:
  - pattern: "UserController"
    replacement: "UserHandler"
    case_variants: true  # Match UserController, userController, user-controller, user_controller
    update_imports: true  # Update import statements pointing to renamed files
```

**Safety Features**:
- Dry-run mode showing all proposed renames
- Collision detection (prevent overwriting existing files)
- Dependency graph analysis to ensure consistency
- Automatic rollback on partial failure
- Preserve file permissions and attributes

**Use Cases**:
1. **Class/Component Refactoring**: Rename a class and all its files
2. **Module Migration**: Change module naming conventions project-wide
3. **Framework Updates**: Adapt to new naming requirements
4. **Brand Changes**: Update product names in files and filenames
5. **Convention Standardization**: Enforce consistent naming patterns

**Benefits**:
- Complete refactoring in single operation
- Maintains codebase consistency
- Reduces manual error-prone work
- Preserves git history with proper moves
- Handles cross-references automatically

**Challenge Considerations**:
- Handle case-insensitive filesystems carefully
- Manage symbolic links appropriately
- Update build configuration files
- Handle generated files and build artifacts
- Coordinate with running processes/IDEs
