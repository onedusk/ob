# Current Development Focus

## Active Context Management System

### Current Implementation
Building a comprehensive context-aware documentation system for Claude Code that maintains understanding during development flows.

### Key Components Being Developed

1. **Memory System Enhancement**
   - CLAUDE.md with documentation imports
   - Modular documentation structure
   - Dynamic context loading based on working directory

2. **Hook System Integration**
   - SessionStart: Load relevant docs at session start
   - PostToolUse: Provide context reminders after edits
   - PreCompact: Preserve critical documentation during compaction
   - UserPromptSubmit: Inject context based on prompts

3. **Specialized Subagents**
   - Documentation-aware development agents
   - Context-preserving specialists
   - Review agents with documentation knowledge

4. **Documentation Organization**
   - Central index in docs/claude-code/doc-index.md
   - Pattern library in .claude/context/
   - Project-specific focus tracking

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- âœ… Enhanced CLAUDE.md with import structure
- âœ… Created documentation index
- âœ… Set up implementation patterns reference
- âœ… Created context directory structure

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Setting up hooks for dynamic loading
- ðŸ”„ Creating specialized subagents
- ðŸ”„ Testing integrated system

### Next Steps
- Configure SessionStart hook for context loading
- Create documentation-aware subagent
- Implement PostToolUse reminder system
- Set up PreCompact preservation hook
- Test complete workflow

## Key Files

- `/docs/claude-code/doc-index.md` - Documentation index
- `/.claude/context/implementation-patterns.md` - Pattern reference
- `/.claude/context/current-focus.md` - This file (current focus)
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Main memory file with imports

## Notes

This system ensures that Claude Code always has relevant documentation context available, reducing the loss of understanding during long development sessions or context switches.
