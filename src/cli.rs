Designed for large codebases with:
  • SIMD-powered regex matching
  • Parallel file processing
  • Automatic backup creation
  • Gitignore awareness
  • Smart empty line cleanup

QUICK EXAMPLES:
  ob scan .                           # Scan current directory with default patterns
  ob replace -d . --preset CleanDebug # Remove all debug code
  ob rename -d . -p 'test_(.*)' -r 'spec_$1'  # Rename test files
  ob undo -d .                        # Restore from backups

For detailed help on any command, use: ob <command> --help"
